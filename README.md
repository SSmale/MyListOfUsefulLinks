# MyListOfUsefulLinks
A place for me to store links that I have found useful but that might also be useful to others

## General

### VS Code
#### [The IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
This is an awesome IDE that I have been using personally and professionally to develop Vue, Alexa (Node) and PHP projects. It is very customisable

#### [My Extention Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iamsimonsmale.simons-extention-pallet)
A curated list of everything I use. Some of the key ones are listed below

#### [Vue.js Extention Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-extensionpack)
Everything you could need for developing vue.js apps

#### [Mocha Sidebar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar)
Adds another tab to the sidebar (as the name suggests) that shows you all your mocha tests and their state. Currently doesn't work with webpack but there is an open pull request!

#### [Spotify Controls](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shyykoserhiy.vscode-spotify)
A vanity one but great for seeing what is playing without leaving

#### [Desktop Icons](https://github.com/dhanishgajjar/vscode-icons)
More vanity but who doesn't like a cool looking icon? I'm rocking the Gryffindor one!

### Podcasts

#### [Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm/)
One stop shop for all things frontend. New episode released every Wednesday and I am always picking something new up from it

### Youtubers

#### [Coding Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxCXg-UvSnTKPOzLH4wJaQ)
Awesome channel of talks from a variety conferences 

#### [Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow)
Great channel that covers code and design.

#### [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)
Another awesome channel that covers beginner and intermediate code

#### [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)
The place to be on a Monday morning. A wide variety of content.

#### [Codingthesmartway](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXQoK41TOcIsWtY-BgB_kQ)
A channel that I find always has good content when looking to learn something new

#### [Steve Schoger](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxqiDtkXtOCNJdckODHk9YA)
Great design tips. Worth a follow on Twitter too.

#### [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q)
A new channel but I really like the way he explains things

## Vue.js

#### [How to set Heroku for CI](http://www.travisluong.com/how-to-deploy-a-vue-js-app-to-heroku/)
The instructions here are to set heroku up so build a Vue project when a new commit is made to the GitHub repo, this removes the need for the dist folder to be in source control

#### [Ultimate Vue.js Course](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-essentials/)
An awesome set of tutorials for vue that I have followed along with, you can see my implementations in their respected repos, there will also be a link to the Heroku instance

#### [Free Vue.js & Firebase course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we4zuQIXmnw)
A really good 1hr tutorial that eases you into vue.js. Check out my repo for the implementation and the heroku instance

#### [I Have Know Idea What I Am Doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQuWEtpDS-0&list=PLQnVLZV0MsRKVTJvKDTFsyWYRLn499JP6)
This is a really well put together, learn together, video series covering Vue.js and VueX with Google's Firebase on the side. Where Sam goes through the code with you as he writes it (and usually learns it) you get to see the mistakes and how to debug as you go. This was also the start of looking at TDD and unit testing in Vue for me.

## Alexa Skills

#### [Alexa-Skill-Local](https://github.com/itachiRedhair/alexa-skill-local)
Your debugging best friend! This is an awesome NPM package with an equally awesome developer who helped me out and had a fix in 3 days of my issue being raised. The package allows you to run a self restarting AWS Lambda server on your dev machine, allowing you to run the debugger or console.log() anything you need to see.

#### [Alexa on GitHub](https://github.com/alexa/)
There are a few sample projects on the official account that helped me get my head around how different parts and flows work within the latest SDK

## Unit Testing
*TODO*

## Home Server
#### [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)
Cheap as chips to run and a tiny form factor, great for experimenting!

#### [RPi for PHP and Email](https://www.pestmeester.nl/)
I followed this post for all the bits that I found relevant and now I have it running 24/7 for pennies a day. Does PHP, Email and eventually Node too

## Noteworthy Products
#### [Travis CI]()
This comes free with the GitHub Student pack and is pretty cool! I have it running the automated testing, building and deploying to my server of the support app

#### [Cloudflare]()
My server sits behind this giving me great control of the DNS and it hides my IP address.

#### [Launch Darkly]()
I first saw this on Fun Fun Function and thought it looked like something worth playing with, was really lucky they gave me a student account that allows me to play with it on one project. Hopefully I will use it in production soon!
